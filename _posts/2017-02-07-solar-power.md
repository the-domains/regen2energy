  Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a
  range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics,
  solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and
  artificial photosynthesis. It is an important source of renewable energy and
  its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active
  solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it
  into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic
  systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the
  energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun,
  selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing
  properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. The large
  magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of
  electricity. The United Nations Development Programme in its 2000 World Energy
  Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837
  exajoules (EJ). This is several times larger than the total world energy
  consumption, which was 559.8 EJ in 2012. In 2011, the International Energy
  Agency said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar
  energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase
  countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible
  and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce
  pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming, and keep fossil fuel
  prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional
  costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning
  investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".
