  Wind power is the use of air flow through wind turbines to mechanically power
  generators for electric power. Wind power, as an alternative to burning fossil
  fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no
  greenhouse gas emissions during operation, consumes no water, and uses little
  land. The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those
  of non-renewable power sources. Wind farms consist of many individual wind
  turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network.
  Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or
  in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and
  stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but
  construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind
  farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated
  off-grid locations. Wind power gives variable power which is very consistent
  from year to year but which has significant variation over shorter time
  scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources
  to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region
  increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant
  conventional production can occur; power management techniques such as having
  excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing
  sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to
  neighboring areas, using vehicle-to-grid strategies or reducing demand when
  wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems In addition,
  weather forecasting permits the electric power network to be readied for the
  predictable variations in production that occur. As of 2015, Denmark generates
  40% of its electric power from wind, and at least 83 other countries around
  the world are using wind power to supply their electric power grids In 2014
  global wind power capacity expanded 16% to 369,553 MW.[17] Yearly wind energy
  production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide
  electric power usage, 11.4% in the EU.
