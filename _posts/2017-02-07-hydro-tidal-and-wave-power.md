  Flowing water creates energy that can be captured and turned into electricity.

  the energy obtained from tides into useful forms of power, mainly electricity.
  Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future electricity

## **Hydro Tidal & Wave Power**

Flowing water creates energy that can be captured and turned into electricity. This is called hydroelectric power or hydropower.

Among sources of renewable energy, tidal power has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability.
